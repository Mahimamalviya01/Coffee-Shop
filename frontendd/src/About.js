        A website for your coffee shop increases your visibility, provides a
        platform to establish yourself as a coffee expert, and lets you launch
        experience-enhancing tools like a takeout system, push notifications,
        and loyalty programs. But your main goal is to transform every site
        visitor into a customer.
